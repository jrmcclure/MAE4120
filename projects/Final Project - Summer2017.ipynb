    "Complete an analysis of the human leg while riding a bicycle.  The goal of the project is to determine the optimum seat height in order to maximum the power output at the rear wheel of the bike.  Model the leg and bike crank as a fourbar linkage.  Be sure to list and justify an assumptions you make while doing the analysis.  The final results should clearly state the optimum height while alos showing supporting plots & figures.  "

    "- Calculate the max & min seat height that allows the user to maintain contact with pedals at all times.\n",
    "  - __Note__: max determined by leg length, min determined by mobilty limitation (assumption based)\n",
    "- Generate polynomial least-squares fit relating leg extension force to knee-angle.\n",
    "- Generate analysis that calculates effective torque as a function of crank angle.  Be sure to use transmission angles to determine the tangential force applied at the pedal.\n",
    "- Determine optimum seat height to maximize total effective work per rotation.\n",
    "  - __Note__: If you cannot find the optimum height, show at least 5 evenly spaced seat heights including the max and min.\n",

    "  - __Note__: Assume straight extension of leg and user simple power (Work / time).  Work can be found by taking the area under the curve relating force and leg extension measured as a distance (Work = $\\int F dx$).  You will need to convert your function F($\\theta$) to a function F(x).  This can be done using the link lengths assuming crank length is 0. \n",
